<h2>Nutritracker</h2>

<p>This application is a fullstack project with a stack of Vue.js for the frontend, Java/Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The goal of this project is to enable users to log in/create accounts, edit their profiles, and track their macro nutrients throughout the day. The purpose behind creating this project was to explore the stack to gain familiarization with it before a college course. One of the courses I went through involved leading a team of students to create an application, and this was to give a reference to the team. This was my first solo full stack project I went through, so there was some issues during the process. The original goals of the project were somewhat overambitious with a tight deadline to completetion. These factors, as well as the course beginning, ultimately led to the project being abandoned. Despite these issues, this still proved to be a good learning experience, some of which will are listed below.</p></br>

<ul>More emphasis on planning, an example was servings conversions being completely forgotten about during the initial planning</ul>
<ul>Greater insight into Document-based databases</ul>
<ul>Design patterns for MongoDB such as working around the 16MB limit</ul>
<ul>Experience with trying to balance features with development time/resources</ul>
<ul>Better understanding into asynchronous promgramming and core concepts such as promises</ul>
<ul>Stronger understanding of Java Date/LocalDate</ul>
<ul>Learning about ISO standard date/time format and issues that can happen with mismatching LocalDate with UTC+0</ul>
